# Natural Language to SQL Query App (Gemini + Streamlit)

This project converts plain English questions into SQL queries using **Google Gemini (2.5 Flash)**.
The generated SQL is executed on a local **SQLite** database, and the results are displayed through a clean **Streamlit** interface.

This project is perfect for beginners, data analysts, and anyone exploring **AI + SQL automation**.

## 🚀 Features

- Converts natural-language questions to SQL
- Uses Gemini 2.5 Flash for SQL generation
- Executes SQL queries on SQLite
- Displays the result instantly in Streamlit
- Simple, fast, and user-friendly

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- SQLite
- Google Generative AI (Gemini 2.5 Flash)

---

## 📥 Installation

Install required dependencies:

```
pip install streamlit google-generativeai
```

(`sqlite3` is included with Python.)

---

## 🔑 API Key Setup

Inside your `app.py` file, replace:

```
genai.configure(api_key="AIz.........................txI")
```

with your actual Google Gemini API key.

Get your API key here:

## 🗄 Database Requirements

Your SQLite database file must be named:

```
employee.db
```

It must contain a table named **employee** with columns:

- employee_name
- employee_role
- employee_salary

Example SQL to create the table:

```
CREATE TABLE employee (
    employee_name TEXT,
    employee_role TEXT,
    employee_salary INTEGER
);
```

## ▶️ How to Run

Run the Streamlit application using:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open automatically, or visit:

```
http://localhost:8501
```

---

## 🔍 How the Application Works

1. User enters a natural-language question, e.g.:“Show all employees working in Data Science role”
2. Gemini converts the question into SQL, e.g.:`SELECT * FROM employee WHERE employee_role = "Data Science";`
3. The SQL is executed on the `employee.db` database.
4. Streamlit displays the results on the screen.

---

## 🧠 Code Workflow

### Generate SQL from natural language:

```python
response = model.generate_content([prompt[0], question])
```

### Execute SQL query using SQLite:

```python
cur.execute(sql)
rows = cur.fetchall()
```

### Display results in Streamlit:

```python
st.header(row)
```

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- Ensure column names in your database match the prompt.
- If Gemini generates an invalid SQL query, try rephrasing the question.
- Since SQL is generated by the AI model, SQL injection is not a concern here.

---

## 🚧 Future Improvements

- Display results using `st.dataframe` for better formatting
- Add exception handling for invalid SQL
- Add support for multiple tables
- Add visualizations (charts, graphs)
- Add user query history
